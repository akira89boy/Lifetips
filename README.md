aKanban
=======

A simple kanban tool holding in one PHP file.

You can rename the file to whatever you want to create multiple boards.

Data will be stored in a .txt file sharing the same name as the .php file. For example, `index.php` will use a `index.txt` file, so don't forget to rename the `index.txt` template too.

Make sure that this file is writable by the webserver, change its owner or:

    chmod 777 index.txt
